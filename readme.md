# Largest Land Mass After Changing One Water Cell

## Problem Statement
You are given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s. Each 1 represents water, and each 0 represents part of a land mass. A land mass consists of any number of 0s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent 0s forming a land mass determines its size. Note that a land mass can twist, meaning it does not have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line, and it can be L-shaped, for example.

Design an algorithm that returns the size of the largest possible land mass after changing exactly one 1 (water cell) to a 0 (land cell). Note that the given matrix will always contain at least one 1. The input matrix may be mutated or transposed.

## Approach
1. Iterate through each cell in the matrix.
2. For each water cell (1), temporarily convert it to a land cell (0).
3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from this cell to find the size of the connected land mass.
4. Update the maximum size if the current size is larger.
5. Restore the original water cell (1).
6. Reset the visited array to prepare for the next iteration.
7. After iterating through all cells, return the maximum size found.

## Implementation

### Functions

#### `dfs(i, j, grid, visited)`
- Performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the size of the connected land mass starting from the given cell `(i, j)`.
- Uses a `visited` array to keep track of visited cells and avoid cycles.
- Returns the size of the connected land mass.

#### `numIslands(grid)`
- Iterates through each cell in the `grid`.
- For each water cell (1), temporarily converts it to a land cell (0).
- Calls `dfs` to find the size of the connected land mass.
- Updates the maximum size if the current size is larger.
- Restores the original water cell (1).
- Resets the `visited` array.
- Returns the maximum size found.

### Input
- `grid`: A two-dimensional list (matrix) containing 0s and 1s, where 1 represents water, and 0 represents land.

### Output
- The size of the largest possible land mass after changing exactly one water cell (1) to a land cell (0).

### Example Usage

```python
input_grid = [["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
              ["0", "0", "1", "1", "0"],
              ["0", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
              ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"]]

print(numIslands(input_grid))
```

Output:
```
6
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O((n * m)^2), where n is the number of rows, and m is the number of columns in the input grid. In the worst case, when all cells are land cells, the DFS traversal needs to visit all cells.
- Space Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of rows, and m is the number of columns in the input grid. The space is used for the `visited` array.
